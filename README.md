# Circular doubly linked list
A circular doubly linked list, also known as a circular two-way linked list, is a more advanced form of a linked list that includes a pointer to both the next and previous node in the sequence. The distinction between a doubly linked and a circular doubly linked list is the same as the distinction between a single linked and a circular linked list. The previous field of the first node and the next field of the last node in the circular doubly linked list do not contain NULL.
